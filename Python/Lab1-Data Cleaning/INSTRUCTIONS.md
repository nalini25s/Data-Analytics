# Instructions for the Data Cleaning and Manipulation Project

This file provides step-by-step instructions for completing the activities in this project.

## Activities in the Project

### 1. Data Cleaning and Manipulation Activity

#### Objective:
Learn how to clean and prepare a dataset using Python and Pandas.

#### Steps:
1. Open the **Data_Cleaning_and_Manipulation_Activity.ipynb** file in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the exercises to:
   - Handle missing values using `.fillna()` or `.dropna()`.
   - Fix inconsistent formats in numeric, date, and text columns.
   - Prepare the dataset for analysis by standardising column types and names.

### 2. Virtual Environment and Pandas Setup

#### Objective:
Set up a Python virtual environment for the project and install necessary dependencies.

#### Steps:
1. Open the **Virtual_Environment_and_Pandas_Setup.ipynb** file in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the instructions to:
   - Create a Python virtual environment.
   - Activate the virtual environment.
   - Install Pandas and other required packages.



## Additional Notes

### Running the Project

1. Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed.
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
    pip install pandas openpyxl ipykernel
   ```
3. Open and run the provided `.ipynb` files.

### Recommended Practices

- Always activate your virtual environment before running the project files.
- Regularly save your progress in Jupyter Notebook.
- If you encounter issues, consult the Pandas documentation or online resources for troubleshooting.
