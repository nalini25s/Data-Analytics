# Data Cleaning and Manipulation Project

This project contains practical activities and examples designed to teach data cleaning and manipulation techniques using Python and Pandas.

## Files in the Project

1. **Data_Cleaning_and_Manipulation_Activity.ipynb**  
   - A Jupyter Notebook with guided exercises for cleaning and preparing datasets.  
   - Covers topics such as handling missing values, and standardising data formats.

2. **Virtual_Environment_and_Pandas_Setup.ipynb**  
   - A Jupyter Notebook providing instructions on setting up a virtual environment and installing Pandas.  
   - Includes steps to create a clean workspace for your Python projects.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system.
- Jupyter Notebook.
