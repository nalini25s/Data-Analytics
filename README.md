# Data Analytics Learning Journey ðŸ“Š

Welcome to my **Data Analytics** repository! This repo is dedicated to showcasing my hands-on projects and exercises as I build my skills in data analysis using **SQL**, **Excel** and **Python**.


## About This Repository

As part of my upskilling journey, Iâ€™m focusing on practical applications of data analytics tools to solve real-world problems, extract insights, and visualise data effectively.

This repo contains:

- SQL queries and scripts to manipulate and analyse datasets  
- Excel workbooks demonstrating formulas, pivot tables, dashboards, and data cleaning  
- Python notebooks using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data exploration and visualisation  


## What Youâ€™ll Find Here

### SQL  
- Queries for data retrieval, filtering, aggregation, and joins  
- Sample exercises on dataset querying and manipulation  

### Excel  
- Interactive dashboards and reports  
- Data cleaning and transformation techniques  
- Use of advanced functions and pivot tables  

### Python  
- Data wrangling with Pandas and NumPy  
- Visualisations with Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- Basic data modelling and exploratory data analysis (EDA)  


## Why Data Analytics?

Data-driven decision making is essential in todayâ€™s business world. Through this learning journey, I aim to combine my background in Business Analysis and Agile methodologies with strong analytical skills to help teams deliver impactful, insight-driven solutions.


## How to Use This Repo

Feel free to explore the folders and files. If you want to try out the Python notebooks, I recommend opening them with [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).

For SQL scripts, you can run them on any SQL database engine like MySQL, SSMS, SQLite.

Excel files can be opened with Microsoft Excel or compatible spreadsheet software.


## Whatâ€™s Next?

I am continuously adding new projects and learning resources here. Stay tuned for upcoming work on:

- Advanced SQL analytics and window functions  
- Power BI dashboard samples  
- Machine learning basics with Python
